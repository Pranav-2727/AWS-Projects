AWS 3-Tier Web Application

Project Name: NatureNest

Project Description:
NatureNest is an AWS 3-tier web application aimed at delivering a smooth online experience for discovering and purchasing nature-based products. The application architecture is divided into three main layers: the Web Tier (Presentation Layer), Application Tier (Logic Layer), and Database Tier (Data Layer). The objective is to build a scalable, secure, and resilient platform leveraging AWS services.
Objectives:
1.	Set up a VPC, which will connect the Web, Application, and Database Tiers. Create two public subnets for the Web Tier and two private subnets each for the Application and Database Tiers.
2.	Design the Web Tier to handle incoming requests and deliver static content to users using an Auto Scaling Group, with public subnets allowing traffic from the internet to the EC2 instances.
3.	Build the Application Tier to process business logic like transactions, payment processing, and database interactions.
4.	Establish the Database Tier to store customer details, product data, and transaction logs using a free-tier MySQL RDS instance.
5.	Conduct connectivity tests by accessing the Web Tier via its public IPv4 address, then SSH into the Web Tier EC2 to ping the Application Tier, and finally test connectivity from the Application Tier to the Database Tier.
 
Part 1: VPC, Subnets, and NAT Gateway Configuration
1.	Go to VPC > Create VPC > Select VPC and more options. Use the IPv4 CIDR block 10.0.0.0/16 and disable the IPv6 CIDR block. Keep Tenancy as Default.
2.	Choose 2 Availability Zones: select ap-south-1a for the first and ap-south-1b for the second.
3.	Enter the CIDR blocks for both public and private subnets.
4.	Select 1 NAT Gateway per AZ and choose None for VPC endpoints. Enable both DNS Hostnames and DNS Resolution, then click Create VPC.
5.	After creation, click View VPC to confirm we now have a VPC, 2 public subnets, 4 private subnets, and 2 NAT gateways.
6.	Go to VPC > Subnets > Select each public subnet, click Actions, and edit the settings to enable auto-assignment of public IPv4 addresses.
7.	Ensure the Internet Gateway is attached to the VPC.
8.	Confirm both NAT Gateways are active.
9.	Navigate to the Route Tables and confirm that public subnets are associated with public route tables and private subnets with private route tables.
 
Part 2: Web Tier Setup
1.	Go to EC2 then Launch Templates then Click Create Launch Template. Name the template and enable the Auto Scaling guidance option.
2.	Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI and the t2.micro instance type.
3.	Use an existing key pair for SSH access.
4.	Create a new security group, assign it to the VPC, and add rules for ICMP, HTTP, and SSH.
5.	Enable auto-assigning of public IPs under advanced network settings.
6.	Add the following script to the User Data section:
   
```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<center><h1>AWS 3-Tier Web Application - NatureNest</h1></center>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```



8.	Create the template and then move to Auto Scaling Groups. Set up an Auto Scaling group with the template, select the public subnets, and proceed.
9.	Attach an Application Load Balancer, selecting the Internet-facing scheme.
10.	Confirm the Target Group is created, and health checks are enabled. Proceed with default settings.
11.	Set the desired capacity for the Auto Scaling group and finalize the setup.
12.	Validate the creation of the Load Balancer and ensure two EC2 instances are running in the Web Tier.
 
Part 3: Application Tier Setup
1.	Create a new launch template for the Application Tier, enabling Auto Scaling guidance.
2.	Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI and t2.micro instance type.
3.	Reuse the existing key pair.
4.	Create a security group, assigning the VPC, and add rules for ICMP and SSH (with Web Tier security group as the source).
5.	Create the template and set up an Auto Scaling Group using the private subnets for the Application Tier.
6.	Attach an Internal Application Load Balancer.
7.	Let AWS automatically create a Target Group and keep default settings for health checks.
8.	Complete the Auto Scaling setup and confirm the desired capacity and scaling policies.
 
Part 4: Database Tier Setup
1.	Go to RDS > Subnet Groups and create a new DB subnet group, selecting the VPC and the private subnets used for the Database Tier.
2.	Under RDS > Create Database, choose the MySQL Engine and Free-tier Template.
3.	Enter a DB instance name and master credentials, selecting db.t2.micro for instance type.
4.	Do not connect the DB to an EC2 resource; instead, select the VPC and DB subnet group created earlier.
5.	Set Public access to No to restrict access to the DB from the internet.
6.	Create a new VPC security group and set inbound rules to allow traffic only from the Application Tierâ€™s security group.
7.	Verify and finalize the creation of the RDS instance.
 
Part 5: Testing and Verification
1.	Access the public IP of a Web Tier EC2 instance in your browser to check if the website is live.

2.  SSH into the Web Tier EC2 and ping a private IPv4 (10.0.3.72) address of an Application Tier EC2 instance.

3.	Install MySQL on the Application Tier EC2 instance and use the RDS endpoint to connect to the MySQL database.
mysql -h <RDS-Endpoint> -P 3306 -u admin -p

Conclusion:
The NatureNest project successfully demonstrated the implementation of an AWS 3-tier architecture, delivering a scalable, resilient, and secure system. Connectivity tests confirmed smooth interactions between the Web, Application, and Database tiers, showcasing the effectiveness of the design.
